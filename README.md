# CSED-2

This is the repository for code relating to CSED Semester 2 Coursework (<b>ActiviTrak</b>).<br/>
The code is divided into 3 segments: front-end, back-end and database. <br/><br/>
<b>Front-end</b> is for UI-related code and communication with back-end. <br/>
<b>Back-end</b> is for algorithmic data processing tasks and linking front-end with the database.<br/>
<b>Database</b> could be for back-end code relating to structuring SQL queries: it exists purely to separate code into more relevant subcategories.<br/>
